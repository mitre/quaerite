_Quaerite_ Examples
===========================
This module offers examples to get your hands dirty on example data
with example tasks.
This set of examples is built around the "TheMovieDB" (_tmdb_).
The inspiration for the use of this dataset comes from Doug Turnbull and John Berryman's book, [Relevant Search](https://www.manning.com/books/relevant-search)
and the "Think Like a Relevance Engineer" training offered by Doug and colleagues at [OpenSource Connections (o19s)](https://opensourceconnections.com).
As you'll see, these examples rely on data kindly made 
available by Doug and _o19s_ -- the ```tmdb.json``` file is hosted by _o19s_, and the ```movie_judgments.csv``` 
file is a reformatting of _o19s_'s [judgment-lists](https://github.com/o19s/solr-tmdb/blob/master/ltr/judgment-lists.html).

Prerequisites
------------
0. Install Java 8 and confirm that it is runnable from the commandline:
 ```java -version```
1. Until there is an official release of ```quaerite```, you'll need to build the project to build the jars:     ```mvn clean install```

2. Download the _tmdb_ ES template [ES 7.x](https://github.com/mitre/quaerite/blob/master/quaerite-examples/example_files/es/es-7.x/tmdb_template.json),
[ES 6.x](https://github.com/mitre/quaerite/blob/master/quaerite-examples/example_files/es/es-6.x/tmdb_template.json)
   
3. Download and unpack ES 7.0.1 from [here](https://www.elastic.co/downloads/elasticsearch).

4. Start ES:  ```./bin/solr start -f -s /path/to/solr/tmdb```

5a. Curl the template: `curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -T tmdb_template.json http://localhost:9200/_template/tmdb`
5b. If using ES >= 7, `curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -T max_buckets.json http://localhost:9200/_cluster/settings`

6. Download _tmdb.json_ from
   [OpenSourceConnections via AWS](http://o19s-public-datasets.s3.amazonaws.com/tmdb.json).

7. Ingest the _tmdb_ data ```java -jar quaerite-examples-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar tmdb.json http://localhost:9200/tmdb```

8. Navigate to [here](http://localhost:9200/tmdb) to confirm that _tmdb_ was loaded into ES.

    
The stage is now set to start searching -- not for documents, but for relevance features.

_TODO_ UPDATE ALL THAT FOLLOWS FOR ES!!!
----------------------------------------

_Quaerite_ -- The Basics -- Running Experiments (```RunExperiments```)
---------------

You can find the files (such as ```movie_judgments.csv``` and 
```experiments.json```) in [this directory](https://github.com/mitre/quaerite/tree/master/quaerite-examples/example_files).


Run some experiments: ```java -jar quaerite-cli-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar RunExperiments -db my_db -j movie_judgments.csv -e experiments.json```

You will find the standard reports in the ```reports/``` directory, including:
* Scores per query -- a score for each query for each experiment
* Scores aggregated by experiment -- a score for each experiment and query set
* A table showing the pairwise statistical significance tests (``paired t-test``) for each pair of experiments
  as scored by any `ScoreAggregator` with a ```exportPMatrix=true```.

From these reports, we can quickly see that the `title` field yields the best results for this ground truth judgment set.
When we look at the p-value matrix (`sig_diffs_ndcg_10.csv`), we can see that `title` is significantly better than  
`overview`, and `overview` is significantly better than `people`.

_Quaerite_ -- Generating Experiments (```GenerateExperiments```)
--------------------------
It is a bit unwieldy to have to specify a definition for all of the experiments you might want to run.
You can specify features and ranges and have ```quaerite``` create all the permutations of those experiments for you.

Be careful:
* Permutation explosion -- the number of experiments grows factorially with each new parameter
* Overfitting -- this is something to be wary of throughout

1. Generate experiments from the `experiment_features_1.json` file, which generates one experiment per field: ```java -jar quaerite-cli-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar GenerateExperiments -f experiment_features_1.json -e experiments_1.json```
2. Generate experiments from the `experiment_features_2.json` file, which generates experiments with up to two fields: ```java -jar quaerite-cli-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar GenerateExperiments -f experiment_features_2.json -e experiments_2.json```
3. Now, let's say you want to test a wider range of fields that include different analyzer chains for the 
three fields used so far (`tb_*` and `tss_*`).  Further, you'd like to experiment with different weight settings, e.g. `[0.0, 1.0, 5.0, 10.0]`, but
you'd still like to see which single field or pair of fields yields the best results on the ground truth set...
Generate experiments from the `experiment_features_3.json` file: ```java -jar quaerite-cli-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar GenerateExperiments -f experiment_features_3.json -e experiments_3.json```
4. Finally, let's say you'd like to try all combinations of fields, and you'd like to add in various `tie` values (e.g. `0.0, 0.1, 0.3`), 
generate experiments from the `experiment_features_4.json` file: ```java -jar quaerite-cli-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar GenerateExperiments -f experiment_features_4.json -e experiments_4.json```

You can now run the experiments in any one of these experiment files: ```java -jar quaerite-cli-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar RunExperiments -db my_db -j movie_judgments.csv -e experiments_3.json```

Each time you run the experiments, the results in the ```results/``` directory will be overwritten.

There are 350 experiments generated by `experiment_features_3.json`, and 4,092 experiments 
generated by `experiment_features_4.json`.

So, one option, if you wanted to be thorough, would be to start running the ~4,100 experiments generated from `experiments_4.json`
and get some coffee because those ~4,100 experiments will take some time.  

The other option, rather than running all of those experiments, 
would be to give the genetic algorithm a try (see the next section:```RunGA```).

Genetic Algorithms (GA) (```RunGA```)
---------------------------------
Rather than going through all of the permutations with ```GenerateExperiments```, it would be useful to apply 
genetic algorithms to learn which combinations of features lead to better results.

The following requires basic knowledge of machine learning train/test methodologies.  
Please see [LTR's core-concepts](https://elasticsearch-learning-to-rank.readthedocs.io/en/latest/core-concepts.html#testing-is-our-model-any-good)
as a refresher.

### Running the GA with a seed file
Run the genetic algorithm from the features specification file with the original experiments as the seed: 
```java -jar quaerite-cli-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar RunGA -db my_db -j movie_judgments.csv -f experiment_features_4.json -e experiments.json```
This will run 4-fold cross-validation (`"nFolds" : 4`).  It will load the `experiments.json` file as the training seeds. 

For each fold, `RunGA` will evaluate the seed experiments on the training portion of the fold:
```
FOLD 0 TRAINING (SEED)
experiment 'train_fold_0_seed_exp_0': .529
experiment 'train_fold_0_seed_exp_1': .306
experiment 'train_fold_0_seed_exp_2': .034
```

It will run 10 generations (`"generations" : 10`) with a population of 15 (`"population" : 15`) for each generation.
For each fold, `RunGA` will output the best training experiments and their scores: 

```
FOLD 0 TRAINING
experiment 'train_fold_0_gen_9_exp_1': .595
experiment 'train_fold_0_gen_8_exp_0': .595
experiment 'train_fold_0_gen_9_exp_4': .595
experiment 'train_fold_0_gen_9_exp_13': .595
experiment 'train_fold_0_gen_9_exp_2': .594
experiment 'train_fold_0_gen_8_exp_12': .594
experiment 'train_fold_0_gen_6_exp_5': .594
experiment 'train_fold_0_gen_9_exp_8': .594
experiment 'train_fold_0_gen_7_exp_13': .594
experiment 'train_fold_0_gen_8_exp_14': .594
```
And then output the performance on `TESTING` for that fold:

```
FOLD 0 TESTING
experiment 'test_fold_0_gen_8_exp_0': .627
```
Finally, after it has finished running each fold, it will print out the 
testing results from each fold and the mean, median and stdev for those rolled-up fold
statistics:

```
FINAL RESULTS ON TESTING:
experiment 'test_fold_2_gen_9_exp_9': .709
experiment 'test_fold_3_gen_7_exp_2': .611
experiment 'test_fold_0_gen_7_exp_0': .578
experiment 'test_fold_1_gen_9_exp_2': .571

mean: .617
median: .594
stdev:.064
```

`RunGA` writes the training experiment `.json` files to `ga_experiments`. 
To find the experiment settings for, say `test_fold_1_gen_9_exp_2`, 
open `ga_experiments/fold1_gen9_experiments.json` and navigate to 
this experiment: `train_fold_1_gen_9_exp_2`.

If we run the GA on the full judgment set we should see an 
improvement from `0.53` from our seed set to roughly `0.62` for 
the top settings identified by the GA. 

**CAVEATS** 

a) any apparent performance improvement will only be reflected in a production system to the
degree that the truth set represents reality.

b) the results on this data set with these fields are disturbingly
no better than throwing in all the fields with random weights (see below).

### Running the GA with a random seed
As before, run the `GA` with `experiment_features_4.json`:
```java -jar quaerite-cli-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar RunGA -db my_db -j movie_judgments.csv -f experiment_features_4.json```

### Running the GA with different GA parameters
As you can see in the `gaConfig` element in `experiment_features_5.json`, 
the settings for the `crossoverProbability`, `mutationProbability`, 
`mutationAmplitude` and `reproductionProbability` have all been modified
from `experiment_features_4.json`; these settings are more conservative.

Now run the `GA` with these different GA parameters: 
```java -jar quaerite-cli-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar RunGA -db my_db -j movie_judgments.csv -f experiment_features_5.json```

### Running the GA with custom train/test sets
Users may want to control the train/test split and turn off the cross-validation.
To do this, specify `-train train.csv` and `-test test.csv` instead of `-j judgments.csv`, as in:
```java -jar quaerite-cli-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar RunGA -db my_db -train movie_judgments_train.csv -test movie_judgments_test.csv -f experiment_features_5.json```

_Quaerite_ -- Finding Features
-----------------------------
Elasticsearch made popular the notion of "SignificantTerms" -- that is, given a query
what facets are statistically interestingly more likely to appear than they would be 
in the overall index.

If you are coming to a new use case and/or a new index, it can be helpful
to understand properties of the ground truth set, especially a ground truth 
set that represents the most common queries.

For example, on one collection, we noticed that, based on the ground truth set, searchers
were most commonly looking for the "sections" type pages, and the most popular queries 
did not appear to be as interested in the "PDF library" or other document sets.

What you do with this information with regard to relevance tuning depends on many factors,
but it can be helpful at least to understand statistical patterns that
your truth set may reveal or contain.

### Finding Features
Run FindFeatures and specify which fields are your facetable fields with the ```-f``` flag:
```java -jar quaerite-cli-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar FindFeatures -db my_db -j movie_judgments.csv -s http://localhost:8983/solr/tmdb -f genres_facet,original_language_facet,production_companies_facet```

For each facet, the results are sorted by the descending order of contrast value. 
For example:
```
production_companies_facet:
   	facet_value=dc comics
   		targCount=16
   		targTotal=1481
   		targPercent=1.08%
   		backgroundCount=23
   		backgroundTotal=26365
   		backgroundPercent=0.09%
   		contrastValue=98.884
   	facet_value=lin pictures
   		targCount=3
   		targTotal=1481
   		targPercent=0.20%
   		backgroundCount=0
   		backgroundTotal=26365
   		backgroundPercent=0.00%
   		contrastValue=53.412
```

Slightly more than one percent (1.08%) of the production companies in the truth set are ```dc_comics```, 
however, in the rest of ```tmdb```, only 23 movies (0.20%) are ```dc_comics```.

Note, that the contrastive value is irrespective of the directionality.  
The following shows that the truth set has _fewer_ ```drama``` movies than you'd expect given the general population.

```
genres_facet:
...
	facet_value=drama
		targCount=402
		targTotal=1481
		targPercent=27.14%
		backgroundCount=8914
		backgroundTotal=26365
		backgroundPercent=33.81%
		contrastValue=27.989
...
```

In this judgment set, the contrastive values are not exceedingly strong.  
In practice, however, this technique has revealed some very important patterns that could help with either:

1. pointing out areas for improvement in supplementing the truth set
2. tuning the boost weights based on popular categories

_Quaerite_ -- Examining the Database
-------------------------------------
_Quaerite_ relies on an in-process H2 database.  To view the contents:

```java -jar quaerite-cli-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar StartDB```

Navigate in a browser to: `http://localhost:8082`

And enter the full path for the `.mv.db` file (without the file suffix): `jdbc:h2:C:/data/my_db/h2_database`

**NOTE:** The Genetic Algorithm exports all experiments (including all parameters) to the `-o output` directory.
If there is any need/interest for any of the code to output more diagnostics
and/or logging, please open a ticket.
